Help us keep the conversation going: [Take the R Consortium's Survey](http://bit.ly/2tuO4NF). Let us know: What are you thinking? What do you make of the way R is developing? How do you use R? What is important to you? How could life be better? What issues should we be addressing? What does the big picture look like? We are looking for a few clues and we would like to hear from the entire R Community.

The R Consortium exists to promote R as a language, environment and community. In order to answer some of the questions above and to help us understand our mission better we have put together the first of what we hope will be an annual survey of R users. This first attempt is a prototype. We don't have any particular hypothesis or point of view. We would like to reach everyone who is interested in participating. So please, take a few minutes to take the survey yourself and help us get the word out. The survey will adapt depending on your answers, but will take about 10 minutes to complete.

The anonymized results of the survey will be made available to the community for analysis. Thank you for participating.
