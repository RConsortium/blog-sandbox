The ISC has determined that an error in the ISC proposal submission process has caused us to lose some, but not all proposals. If you submitted a project proposal to the ISC and have received a confirmation email then you are fine. However, if you have not received a confirmation email, please email your proposal as a pdf attachment to proposal@r-consortium.org

If you do not receive a confirmation within 24 hours please email hadley@rstudio.com. Once again, if you have already received a confirmation that your proposal was received you do not need to take further action.

The revised deadline for submitting proposals is now midnight PST, Sunday October 15th.

We apologize for the inconvenience.
