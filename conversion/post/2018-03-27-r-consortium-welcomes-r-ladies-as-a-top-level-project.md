![](https://www.r-consortium.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2018/03/R-LadiesGlobal_RBG_online_LogoWithText-300x300.png)In 2016, R-Ladies started their effort for a global expansion, with the [help from the R-Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2016/08/22/the-r-consortium-funds-three-projects-in-july). Back then there were only 4 active chapters (San Francisco, Taipei, Twin Cities  and London) and the goal was to expand to 5-10 cities within the next year. The enthusiasm within the R community for local R-Ladies chapters far exceeded any possible expectations! As of March 2018, the organization has over 90 chapters and almost 19,000 members.

There are [R-Ladies chapters in 45 countries around the globe](https://rladies.org/), with many chapters hosting monthly events.

With this fast growth, it became apparent to the R Consortium ISC that this project needs long term investment for success. The diversified voice of R-Ladies, speaking not only as a group representing gender minorities in tech but also a group attracting new R users, aligned with the R Consortium's defined [Code of Conduct](https://wiki.r-consortium.org/view/R_Consortium_and_the_R_Community_Code_of_Conduct) and its desires for building a more diverse and inclusive R community.

R Consortium ISC is pleased to announce and welcome [R-Ladies as a top level project](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/r-ladies). R-Ladies has shown a big commitment within the R community and [becoming a top level project](https://wiki.r-consortium.org/view/Top_Level_Projects) will provide them a longer term budget cycle (3 years instead of 1 year) to support their community. R-Ladies will also have a voting seat on the ISC (represented by [Gabriela de Queiroz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrieladequeiroz/)).

We invite all in the R community to congratulate R-Ladies on this milestone, and look forward to ensuring they have the infrastructure and funding to bring more diversity to the R community.
