The first task was to appoint members of the Board of the R Consortium, and to that end we are pleased to announce the following board members:

JJ Allaire, RStudio

Louis Bajuk-Yorgan, Tibco

John Chambers, R Foundation

Richard Pugh, Mango Solutions

David Smith, Microsoft
We are also pleased to announce that Richard Pugh has been elected as President of the R Consortium board.

The next step is to form the Infrastructure Steering Committee, which will then select and oversee the various projects undertaken by the R Consortium on behalf of its members and the R Community. The R Consortium Board welcomes suggestions from the R Community of suitable projects pursue. We will publish a formal process for proposals soon, but in the meantime we welcome suggestions from anyone to [info@r-consortium.org](mailto:info@r-consortium.org).[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]
