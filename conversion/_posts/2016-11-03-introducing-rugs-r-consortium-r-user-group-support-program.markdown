The R Consortium is very happy to announce RC RUGS, the R Consortium R User Group Support Program. We believe that user groups are a great strength of the R Community and we would like to do all that we can to encourage the formation of new user groups and to help existing R user groups flourish.




The 2016/2017 RC RUGS program provides financial support for R User Groups based on their size and the frequency with which they meet. “Vector” level membership, appropriate for new and small groups, comes with a grant of $150 per year. Larger, established groups that have a track record of meeting frequently may qualify for “Matrix” or “Array” level membership with respective annual grants of $500 and $1,000.
