<p>The R Consortium, Inc. is a group organized under an open source governance and foundation model to support the worldwide community of users, maintainers and developers of R software. Its members include leading institutions and companies dedicated to the use, development and growth of R.
The R language is an open source environment for statistical computing and graphics. The R community has enjoyed significant growth, with more than 2 million users worldwide. A broad range of organizations have adopted the R language as a data science platform, including biotech, finance, research and high technology industries. The R language is often integrated into third-party analysis, visualization and reporting applications, and runs on a wide variety of computing platforms.</p>

<p>The central mission of the R Consortium is to work with and provide support to the R Foundation and key organizations and groups developing, maintaining, distributing and using R software. Its activities and programs include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Promoting the growth and development of R as a leading platform for data science and statistical computing.

<ul>
<li>Members of the R Consortium are recognized as supporters of the R Project and the R community, and the R Consortium represents its members to the R community and to the media.</li>
