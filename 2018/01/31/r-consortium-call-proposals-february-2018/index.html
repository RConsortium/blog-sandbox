<p>The first ISC Call for Proposals for 2018 is now open. We are looking for ambitious projects that will contribute to the infrastructure of the R ecosystem and benefit large sections of the R community. However, we are not likely to fund proposals that ask for large initial cash grants. The ISC tends to be conservative with initial grants, preferring projects structured in such a way that significant initial milestones can be achieved with modest amounts of cash.</p>

<p>As with any proposed project, the more detailed and credible the project plan, and the better the track record of the project team, the higher the likelihood of receiving funding. Please be sure that your proposal includes measurable objectives, intermediate milestones, a list of all team members who will contributing work and a detailed accounting of how the grant money will be spent.</p>

<p>But, most importantly - don&rsquo;t let this talk of large projects dampen your enthusiasm! We are looking for projects with impact, regardless of their size. With this call for proposals, we are hoping to stimulate creativity and help turn good ideas into tangible benefits. Look around your corner of the R Community, what needs doing and how can the R Consortium help?</p>

<p>Please do not submit proposals to sponsor conferences, workshops or meetups. These requests should be sent directly to the R Consortium&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/r-user-group-support-program">R User Group and Small Conference Support Program</a>.</p>

<p>To submit a proposal for ISC funding, read the <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/call-for-proposals">Call for Proposals page</a> and submit a self-contained pdf using the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/YCVnRAvmA4zefXIC2">online form</a>. You should receive confirmation within 24 hours.</p>

<p>The deadline for submitting a proposal is midnight PST, Sunday April 1, 2018.</p>
