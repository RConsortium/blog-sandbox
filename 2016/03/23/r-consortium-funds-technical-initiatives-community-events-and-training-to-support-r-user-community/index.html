      <p>_ R Consortium awards seven grant recipients and forms two working groups to advance R programming language_</p>

<p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO – March 23, 2016 –</strong> The <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/">R Consortium</a>, an open source foundation to support the R user community and a Linux Foundation project, today is announcing funding for seven community projects and the formation of two technical working groups. These milestones advance the R Consortium&rsquo;s mission to support the R community through the identification, development and implementation of infrastructure projects that drive standards and best practices for R code.</p>

<p>The R programming language provides an unparalleled interactive environment for data analysis, modeling, and visualization. R is a top-20 programming language (<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe_index?page=index">see: TIOBE Ranking Index</a>), and its popularity is expected to grow with data demand. The R Consortium was founded to support the richness and diversity of the R community and to ensure that it continues to meet new data challenges as they arise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The R Consortium is proud to support initiatives that will positively impact many R users, including community events, training, packages for critical infrastructure and building consensus around important future challenges,&rdquo; said Hadley Wickham, Infrastructure Steering Committee Chair, R Consortium. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to announce our second round of ISC grants.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Seven R-focused Projects Receive Grants</strong></p>

<p>The R Consortium awarded the first grant in November 2015 to <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/news/announcement/2015/11/r-consortium-awards-first-grant-help-advance-popular-programming-language">R-Hub</a>, a service for developing, building, testing and validating R packages. Today the R Consortium is providing funding for seven additional initiatives to develop tools and resources for the R user community, bringing total grant funding to $200,000. Today&rsquo;s grant recipients include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Unified Framework for Distributed Computing in R:</strong> Many Big Data platforms expose R-based interfaces that lack standardization and are therefore difficult to learn. This project will develop a common framework to simplify and standardize how users program distributed applications in R, ultimately reducing duplication of effort.</li>
</ul>

<p>_          Michael Lawrence (R core, Genetech), Edward Ma (Hewlett Packard Enterprise), and  Indrajit Roy (Hewlett Packard Labs)_</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Improving Database Interface (DBI):</strong> Database access is an important cornerstone of the R ecosystem, but today&rsquo;s specifications – data type transformation, return values, error conditions – remain vague and result in data analysis errors. This project aims to improve database access in R so that porting code is simplified and less prone to error.</li>
</ul>

<p>_         Kirill Müller_ (<em>ETH Zürich)</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>R Implementation, Optimization and Tooling Workshops (RIOT):</strong> RIOT 2016 is a one-day workshop to unite R language developers, identify R language development and tooling opportunities, increase involvement of the R user community and more.</li>
</ul>

<p>_        Mark Hornick, Lukas Stadler and Adam Welc (Oracle)_</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>R Localization Proposal (RL10N):</strong> Although the R language is used globally, very few R packages are available in languages other than English. The RL10N project will make it easier for R developers to include translations in their own packages.</li>
</ul>

<p>_        Richie Cotton (Weill Cornell Medicine in Quatar) and Thomas Leeper (The London School of Economics and Political Science)_</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sat R Days:</strong> &ldquo;SatRDays&rdquo; are community-led, regional conferences to support collaboration, networking and innovation within the R community. Initially three events will be hosted, with plans for additional meet-ups as the R user base grows.</li>
</ul>

<p>_       Gergely Daroczi (Hungarian R user group) and Steph Locke (Mango Solutions)_</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Simple Features Access for R:</strong> Using the &ldquo;Simple Features&rdquo; standard supported by the Open Geospatial Consortium and the International Organization for Standardization, this tool will simplify analysis on modern geospatial data.</li>
</ul>

<p>_     Edzer Pebesma (Institute for Geoinformatics, University of Muenster)_</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Software Carpentry R Instructor Training:</strong> This two-day in-person training course will introduce the basics of R programming and address the growing demand for training resources for the R language.</li>
</ul>

<p>_     John Blishak, Jonah Duckles_, _Laurent Gatto, David LeBauer, and Greg Wilson _(<em>Software Carpentry)</em></p>

<p>The R Consortium ISC awards grants based on the critical nature of the problem(s) being addressed; the solvability of work involved; the amount of financial aid needed; and level of community support. A community-wide call for proposals is now open until July 10, 2016. To submit a proposal or learn more information, please visit <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/about/isc/proposals">https://www.r-consortium.org/about/isc/proposals</a> or email <a href="mailto:proposals@r-consortium.org">proposals@r-consortium.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Working Groups Enable Collaboration</strong></p>

<p>The R Consortium is also forming its first two working groups to facilitate collaboration and focus the community&rsquo;s efforts toward two critical areas needed to advance the R programming language: standardization and best practices.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Future-proof native APIs for R:</strong> This working groups will assess current native API usage, gather community input, and work towards an easy-to-understand, consistent and verifiable API that will drive R language adoption.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Code Coverage Tool for R:</strong> Helping to improve software quality, the code coverage tool will address feature and platform limitations of existing tools while also promoting the use of code coverage more systematically within the R ecosystem.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>R Consortium is an independently supported software project hosted by The Linux Foundation. The Linux Foundation&rsquo;s projects span the enterprise, mobile, embedded and life sciences markets and are backed by many of the largest names in technology.
