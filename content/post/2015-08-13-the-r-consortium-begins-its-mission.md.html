The first task was to appoint members of the Board of the R Consortium, and to that end we are pleased to announce the following board members:</p>
<p>JJ Allaire, RStudio</p>
<p>Louis Bajuk-Yorgan, Tibco</p>
<p>John Chambers, R Foundation</p>
<p>Richard Pugh, Mango Solutions</p>
<p>David Smith, Microsoft We are also pleased to announce that Richard Pugh has been elected as President of the R Consortium board.</p>
<p>The next step is to form the Infrastructure Steering Committee, which will then select and oversee the various projects undertaken by the R Consortium on behalf of its members and the R Community. The R Consortium Board welcomes suggestions from the R Community of suitable projects pursue. We will publish a formal process for proposals soon, but in the meantime we welcome suggestions from anyone to <a href="mailto:info@r-consortium.org">info@r-consortium.org</a>.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]</p>
