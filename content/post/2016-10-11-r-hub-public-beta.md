**Oct 25, 2016 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM PDT**

R-HUB, the most significant project that the R Consortium has funded to date, is making progress. The major goal of R-Hub is to develop a modern platform for simplifying and improving the R package development process. It will provide facilities to assist package creation, building binaries, and for publishing, distributing and maintaining packages.

Gábor Csárdi, R-Hub's lead developer, will describe the latest development in R-Hub RC 1.0 and provide an overview of the first public beta.
