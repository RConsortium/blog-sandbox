<p>The ISC has determined that an error in the ISC proposal submission process has caused us to lose some, but not all proposals. If you submitted a project proposal to the ISC and have received a confirmation email then you are fine. However, if you have not received a confirmation email, please email your proposal as a pdf attachment to <a href="mailto:proposal@r-consortium.org">proposal@r-consortium.org</a></p>
<p>If you do not receive a confirmation within 24 hours please email <a href="mailto:hadley@rstudio.com">hadley@rstudio.com</a>. Once again, if you have already received a confirmation that your proposal was received you do not need to take further action.</p>
<p>The revised deadline for submitting proposals is now midnight PST, Sunday October 15th.</p>
<p>We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
