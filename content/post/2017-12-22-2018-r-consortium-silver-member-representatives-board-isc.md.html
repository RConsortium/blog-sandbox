<p>Per the R Consortium <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/about/bylaws">ByLaws</a> and <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/about/isc-charter">ISC Charter</a>, the Silver Member class is entitled to elect individuals representative of the Silver Member class for a term starting January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 representative to the ISC</p></li>
<li><p>1 Silver Member Board Director per every 7 Silver Members, subject to provisions 4.2 and 4.3(d) of the R Consortium ByLaws. This means the Silver Member class can elect up to 2 Board Directors representing the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These elections ran during the month of November 2017, with 3 nominees for Silver Member Board Director and 3 nominees for the Silver Member ISC representative.</p>
