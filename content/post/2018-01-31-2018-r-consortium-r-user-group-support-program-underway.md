In just one year, the R Consortium through the R User Group Support program sponsored **76 R user groups and 3 small conferences with cash grants totaling just under $30,000**. This program aligns with the R Consortium mission of [fostering the continued growth of R community and the data science ecosystem](https://www.r-consortium.org/about), and has already helped bring more people to using R and contributing to the community.

Coming off a successful 2017, we are pleased to announce the opening of the 2018 program today. While the structure of the 2018 program is similar to last year's program with the [multiple levels of support](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/r-user-group-support-program), we have enhanced the program based on feedback from last year's funded user groups.

## Complimentary Meetup.com Pro Account

After a year of supporting user groups, we've found that the primary cost for each group is having a page on [meetup.com](http://meetup.com) or thier own website ( though the majority prefer the meetup.com platform ). This leaves less funds available things like meetup space, food, or even swag, and thus put more of a burden on the group leaders to attract people to the group.

This year we've leveraged our relationship with the [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org), and now will provide each user group a complimentary [meetup.com Pro account](https://www.meetup.com/pro). Leveraging this not removes one less cost concern for group leaders, but it will also better enable us to promote user groups through the many features the platform provides for groups. For all the details of the program, eligibility requirements for the three levels of user group grants, the schedule of grants and the details of signing up for the meetup.com pro account please see the [R Consortium's R User Group Support Program webpage](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/r-user-group-support-program).

## Small Conference Support

We've also seen an increase in the number of smaller, regional focused R conferences happening around the world. Grassroots events like this are critical for sustainability in the R community, but need financial support and community awareness to be successful.  Several reached out last year and we provided funding with excess funds in the program with [great](https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2018/01/17/recap-ropenscis-ozunconf-october-2017-melbourne) [results](https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2017/12/20/recap-uros2017-conference).

These events perfectly align with the mission of the R User Group Support program, we're formally expanding it this year to provide cash grants in the $500 to $1,000 range to continue to encourage small, R-focused conferences and meetings organized by non-profit or volunteer groups are the world.
