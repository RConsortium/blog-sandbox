**SAN FRANCISCO and BOSTON (EARL Conference), November 2, 2015 –** The [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/), a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project and open source foundation to support the R user community, today announced it is awarding its first grant to advance the infrastructure supporting the R programming language. Led by the R Consortium Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC), the grant program provides financial support to projects that will address critical needs of the R user community.

The [R Consortium ISC](https://www.r-consortium.org/about/isc) is organized to provide technical oversight and recommendations for grants for projects that help the R user community. The ISC grant program is designed to broadly support the R community including software development; developing new, teaching materials; documenting best practices; promoting R to new audiences; and standardizing APIs or doing research.

The R Consortium's first grant is awarded to Gábor Csárdi, Ph.D., to implement [R-Hub](https://github.com/r-hub/proposal), a new service for developing, building, testing and validating R packages. R-Hub will be complementary to both CRAN, the major repository for open source R packages, and R-Forge, the platform supporting R package developers. R-Hub will provide build services, continuous integration for R packages and a distribution mechanism for R package sources and binaries.

Goals for R-Hub include:

●      simplify the R package development process: creating a package, building binaries and continuous integration, publishing, distributing and maintaining it;

●      provide services free for all members of the community;

●      encourage community contributions; and

●      pre-test CRAN package submissions to ease burden on CRAN maintainers.

 "R-Hub will modernize and improve the entire process of developing and testing R packages," said Hadley Wickham, Infrastructure Steering Committee Chair, R Consortium. "We are dedicating a large portion of R Consortium resources to help fund projects that will help sustain the technical growth of the R community. We very much look forward to it."
The ISC awards grants based on the critical nature of the problem(s) being addressed; the solvability of work involved; the amount of financial aid needed; and level of community support. Including today's grant, the ISC plans to award nearly $200,000 in grants over the next several months. A community-wide call for proposals is now open until January 10, 2016. To submit a proposal or learn more information, please visit <https://www.r-consortium.org/about/isc/proposals> or email [proposals@r-consortium.org](mailto:proposals@r-consortium.org).
The open source R programming language is used by statisticians, analysts and data scientists for statistical computing. It provides an interactive environment for data analysis, modeling and visualization. The R Consortium complements the work of the R Foundation, a non profit organization that develops and maintains the R language. The R Consortium focuses on user outreach and other projects designed to assist the R user and developer communities.

An R Consortium Forum panel discussion at the annual EARL Conference will be held with several members of the R Consortium Board, include JJ Allaire (RStudio), Lou Bajuk-Yorgan (TIBCO Software), Richard Pugh (Mango Solutions) and David Smith (Microsoft) on November 3 at 5 pm ET.
