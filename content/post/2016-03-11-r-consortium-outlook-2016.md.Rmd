The project is as active as ever, with the new R 3.2.4 just released (and R 3.3.0 following up very soon), and the milestone of 8,000 contributed packages was passed just last month (coincidentally, on the 16th anniversary of the release of R 1.0.0). Meanwhile, the popularity of the R language continues unabated: R was ranked #6 in [IEEE's Top Programming Languages of 2015](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3a%2f%2fspectrum.ieee.org%2fcomputing%2fsoftware%2fthe-2015-top-ten-programming-languages&data=01%7c01%7cdavidsmi%40microsoft.com%7c2ce145651d85484a415108d349ba082f%7c72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7c1&sdata=e1qY84nLJgVmeptXynr8en93FFaTJjcL9MQ%2bhKT1qxo%3d), and it's one of the [fastest-growing languages on StackOverflow](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3a%2f%2fjkunst.com%2fr%2fwhat-do-we-ask-in-stackoverflow%2f&data=01%7c01%7cdavidsmi%40microsoft.com%7c2ce145651d85484a415108d349ba082f%7c72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7c1&sdata=0AiSjJfo1t16tcJoLNLkx1QENit%2frvw0nIt03zQ%2fTzA%3d).

This popularity makes the mission of the R Consortium as important as ever: to support to the R community, the R Foundation, and everyone using, maintaining and distributing R software. Founded just last July, 2015 was a year of "spinning up" for the R Consortium: establishing a [board](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.r-consortium.org%2fabout%2fgovernance&data=01%7c01%7cdavidsmi%40microsoft.com%7c2ce145651d85484a415108d349ba082f%7c72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7c1&sdata=8Mjkq4CQFpVx36kii0%2fj6uzAT2lHly%2be%2ffIp9M9Rfj8%3d), recruiting [members](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.r-consortium.org%2fabout%2fmembers&data=01%7c01%7cdavidsmi%40microsoft.com%7c2ce145651d85484a415108d349ba082f%7c72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7c1&sdata=gSY99SEgXupK1K2e0eNRPMleBWRhA0XzVtfOBV997HQ%3d), and setting a charter for the [steering committee](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.r-consortium.org%2fabout%2fisc&data=01%7c01%7cdavidsmi%40microsoft.com%7c2ce145651d85484a415108d349ba082f%7c72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7c1&sdata=eUQt2Jc1AYHfulyrMsSVQe63KOqjzPFVjknl%2fXIhayA%3d). With that groundwork behind us, 2016 will be a year of action. The Consortium will be distributing funds to community-nominated projects and soliciting more proposals, supporting the [useR! 2016 conference in Stanford](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3a%2f%2fuser2016.org%2f&data=01%7c01%7cdavidsmi%40microsoft.com%7c2ce145651d85484a415108d349ba082f%7c72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7c1&sdata=IBAVPCC1Q2HE4g9GUKWt77oghg54EzwSHI40LcMNkuc%3d), and continuing to popularize R as the leading platform for data science research and applications.

The R Consortium recently welcomed [Avant](https://www.avant.com/) and [Procogia](http://procogia.com/) as new Silver [members](https://www.r-consortium.org/about/members).
